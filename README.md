<h1>AndroidCoolCoding</h1>

This is a repository used to group different (and relatively small) Android projects that are used for diferent reasons, going from learning new libraries, concepts and architectures to verify ideas and concepts that I think can be used in larger projects (or not, that's why I created this repo :) ). 

<h2>NavigationComponents1</h2>
<p>This is a demo application to learn the usage of <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/">Navigation Component Architecture</a>.
Check the project's readme.md for more information.
</p>

<h2>ArchitectureComponents</h2>
<p>A very simple application used to validate some ideas about  <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/">View Models</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata/">Live Data</a> </br> and how they can be used with Kotlin coroutines.
</p>

<h2>PagingLibrary</h2>
<p>A demo application that can be used as a very simple example of usage of <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/">Paging Library</a></br>
</p>
