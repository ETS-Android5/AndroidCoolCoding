#### PermissionsExample
This is a super simple Android application used to learn (and to have an example for future usages) of how the [Android Permissioms Model](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) works and what can we do (and can't do) with the framework.
It is basically composed of a wizard-type screen that requests a specific permission when the 2nd page of the wizard is reached.
This also allows me to have an idea of how to request runtime permissions from a Fragment, ignoring the need of an Activity for it.
